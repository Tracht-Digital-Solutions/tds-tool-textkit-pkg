# AGENTS.md — tds-tool-textkit-pkg

A **tool package** for the TDS tools platform (password generator + UTM builder).
Read `tds-tools-contract-pkg`'s AGENTS.md for the platform model.

## Shape

- `src/index.ts` — the `ToolPackManifest` (two tools). Only file tsup compiles +
  `tsc` type-checks.
- `tools/*.astro` — shells the site's `/tools/[slug]` template renders.
- `islands/*.tsx` — hydrated React islands, fully client-side (no deps, no network).

## Tests

`npm run test:run` (vitest). Islands opt into jsdom via a `@vitest-environment`
docblock; the manifest suite runs in node.

- **Control the RNG when asserting pool contents.** The look-alike-exclusion
  test stubs `crypto.getRandomValues` to walk the pool sequentially so every
  pool character appears. With a random 64-char sample the assertion passes by
  luck ~1% of the time even with the filter removed — verified: the sampling
  version did NOT catch that mutation, the deterministic one does.
- `uses crypto.getRandomValues, not Math.random` is a security regression
  guard, not a style check. Keep it.
- The UTM `utm_term` exemption from slugify is deliberate (a keyword is a
  search phrase, not a slug) and is pinned by a test.
- Range inputs ignore typing: set `value` through the native setter and
  dispatch `input`, or React swallows the change.

## Gotchas

- **This pack ships NO CSS — every control must carry a shared class.** The tools
  site renders on the `panel` surface, and a surface layer only sets tokens: they
  reach an element through `btn` / `chip` / `field-boxed` / `tds-card`. A
  `<button>` without `btn` therefore has no padding, no radius and no 44px touch
  target, and an `<input>` without `field-boxed` renders **invisible**, because
  Tailwind preflight zeroes borders.
  Until 2026-08-16 every button in this pack was bare and the markup wrote its own
  radii — `rounded-full` tabs (the *marketing* pill) and `rounded-lg` inputs, long
  after the site had moved to the panel. That is why the tools rounded differently
  from the panels. `npm run lint:primitives` runs in CI and fails on a bare
  control; the script is a byte-identical copy of the seed in `tds-ext-template-pkg`.
- **Never hand-author a radius, and do not reach for `rounded-[var(--tds-radius-*)]`
  either.** Tailwind does not generate arbitrary values out of a package inside
  `node_modules`, so from here that ships as no rule at all. Use the shared class.
- **Attribute order no longer matters, and neither does what you name a class
  constant** (fixed 2026-08-16). `lint-primitives` used to match a tag with
  `[^>]*>`, which stops at the first `>` — and an arrow handler
  (`onClick={() => …}`) supplies one, so a correctly classed control written after
  its handler was reported as bare. It also read `className={x}` as the literal
  text `x`, so `{field}` passed and `{area}` did not. The script now walks the tag
  tracking quotes and brace depth, and resolves a local `const` to its string.
  Both workarounds are gone; all 20 repos carry the identical fixed script.
- **`islands/` is NOT type-checked here** (`tsconfig` covers `src/**/*` only). The
  islands are compiled by the tds-tools-frontend build — that build is the real
  gate for a markup change, not `npm run type-check`.

- `component` = package subpath via `exports`, never relative.
- Tool `id` + `slug` globally unique across composed packs.
- Password generator MUST use `crypto.getRandomValues`, never `Math.random`.
- Islands/.astro compile at the site build (not in tsconfig `include`).
- Version stays in the `0.1.x` line (site pins `^0.1.x`).
