# AGENTS.md — tds-tool-textkit-pkg

Tool pack for the public tools platform: password generator and UTM builder.
It builds against `@tracht-digital-solutions/tds-tools-contract` and is composed into
`tds-tools-frontend` at build time. Both tools run fully in the browser, with no
dependencies and no network.

The platform rules (unique ids, package-subpath components, contract stability)
live in `tds-tools-contract-pkg/AGENTS.md`. Read that first.

## Commands

```bash
npm install --no-package-lock   # never npm ci; CI has no lockfile
npm run build                   # tsup, compiles src/index.ts only
npm run type-check              # tsc, covers src/** only
npm run test:run                # vitest
npm run lint:primitives         # fails on a control without a shared class
```

## Hard rules

- **Every push to `main` publishes a `@latest` patch** and rebuilds `tds-tools-frontend`.
  Don't bump the version by hand for a patch. A docs-only commit carries `[skip ci]`.
- The password generator uses `crypto.getRandomValues`, never `Math.random`.
- Translate labels only. Values (UTM keys, slugs, entropy thresholds) are identical in DE and EN.
- Ship no CSS. Every control carries a shared `tds-shared` class.
- `component` in the manifest is a package subpath resolved via `exports`, never a relative path.
- Tool `id` and `slug` stay unique across all composed packs.
- Stay inside the `0.2.x` line. The site pins `^0.2.0`, so a minor bump needs a coordinated repin.
